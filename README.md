#  Folder descriptions:
Hand-base: It means when we regard HandGesture dataset as the source data.And 'WiFi-base' mean the same.
Hand-base/RFID:It means when we regard RFID dataset as the target data.And 'USC-HAD','WiFi' mean the same.

04Seg_TrainSiamese_StateInference/01TrainSiameseNetwork:This is for training the state inference model.

04Seg_TrainSiamese_StateInference/02LoadModel_StateInference:This is for inferring the state labels of discretized sensor data bins. 

05Segment_CnnSegAlgorithm1: This is used to segment activities according to the state labels of CSI data bins generated by 04Segment_TrainSiamese_StateInference.

06Calulate_RMSE:This is used to calculate the F_score and RMSE of our model.
